What's new ?
* Rotation2dOperator for rotations in a plane
* Rotation3dOperator, about 1 axis (3 conventions), 2 axes (6 conventions, including intrinsic and extrinsic rotations) or 3 axes (12 conventions)
* Spherical2CartesianOperator & Cartesian2SphericalOperator with conventions 'zenith,azimuth', 'azimuth,zenith', 'elevation,azimuth' and 'azimuth,elevation'
* NormalizeOperator to obtain unit vectors
* DegreesOperator & RadiansOperator for degrees/radians conversions
* Implement __ne__ for Operators
* Add helper function float_dtype. Rename complex_dtype_for->complex_dtype
* Add helper functions one, pi and zero, which return a value of the specified dtype.
* API change in Operator's rule:
    - in unary rules, use 'C', 'T', 'H' or 'I' instead of '.C', '.T', '.H' or '.I'
    - binary rule subjects are now specified by a 2-tuple
    - use Operator subclass type instead of the the string '{MyOperator}'
* API change: IntegrationTrapezeWeightOperator -> IntegrationTrapezeOperator

Under the hood:
* benchmark and memory_usage functions moved to a distinct distribution pybenchmarks
* Add test and coverage commands in setup.py
* Automatically compute adjoint from transpose, transpose from adjoint, inverse_adjoint from inverse_transpose and inverse_tranpose from inverse_adjoint
* Fix attribute copy during scalar absorption
* In binary rules, use '==' instead of 'is' in subject matching
* In assert_same, allow broadcasting for integer types
* Remove obsolete Operator's isalias method
* Make shape_input, shape_output and inplace_reduction non-settable flags
* Take forward FFTW instance dtype into account for the backward instance
* Remove DirectOperatorFactory and ReverseOperatorFactory
* DenseOperator output and input shapes can now be implicit. Don't rely on this feature yet, it will be changed in future versions.
