This is the first release.
The pyoperators package is the result of the merging of the packages "Tamasis/PACS":https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-pacs (v3) by Pierre Chanial and the package "linear_operators":https://github.com/nbarbey/linear_operators by Nicolas Barbey, picking up the best out of the two.
