What's new ?
* New operators: ReductionOperator, SumOperator, ProductOperator, MinOperator, MaxOperator, MinMaxOperator.
* New operator IntegrationTrapezeWeightOperator.
* New composite operator GroupOperator: same as CompositionOperator, but without the associativity rules.
* New C-ufuncs, used in SoftThresholdingOperator and HardThresholdingOperator.
* Improved asoperator: handle callable, ufunc, matrices, scalars, add 'constant' keyword to tell whether scalars should be translated into HomothetyOperator or ConstantOperator.
* RoundOperator: add methods 'rhtmi' (round half to minus infinity), 'rhtpi' (round half to plus infinity).
* Make todense method work with uncontrained output shape operators.
* Set dtype to None for DiagonalOperators with only 1 and 0 on the diagonal.
* Set 'square' flag automatically for ufuncs. Infer 'real' flag from ufunc's types.
* Fix flags shape_input, shape_output in CommutativeCompositeOperator and CompositionOperator.
* Add 'idempotent' flag to RoundOperator and HardThresholdingOperator.

Under the hood:
* Make composite operators behave like regular Operators (in terms of attribute handling and merging) to enable subclassing them.
* Implement CompositionOperator and CommutativeCompositeOperator associativity through binary rules.
* Add helper routine find in utils.
* Add skiptest decorator.
* Speed up all_eq helper routine.
