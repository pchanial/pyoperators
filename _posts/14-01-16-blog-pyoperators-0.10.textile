What's new ?
* SparseOperator. The sparse storage can be anyone from the scipy.sparse package (except the LIL format, which is not suited for matrix-vector multiplication)
* Change binary rule priorities to favour specialized rules and subclasses
* Add mechanism to prevent CompositeOperator from morphing into their unique component. This mechanism allow GroupOperator to only have one operand
* Remove DiagonalNumexprNonSeparableOperator, it's not possible to avoid calling get_data in __init__ and it complicates the broadcasting operators too much
* API change: the mask convention for PackOperator and UnpackOperator is changed. True means kept (similar to Fortran's pack & unpack). Make PackOperator and UnpackOperator subclass BroadcastingBase

Under the hood:
* Handle infinity in assert_same
* Improve rule's __str__ when the predicate in a lambda function
* Add '_reset' method for Operators
* Add 'broadcast' keyword to strshape
* Add debugging for the composition and commutative rules
* Cleanup broadcasting operators, including shape and dtype. Improved testing
* Fix 'square' flag when morphing from a DiagonalOperator or a MaskOperator to ZeroOperator
* In 'todense', use dtype=int when the operator's dtype is None
* Hack to add shapein and shapeout to Operator's __repr__
* In CommutativeCompositeOperator, get info from the operands before applying the simplification rules
* Add ZeroOperator rule for MultiplicationOperator. Make sure a copy of the other operator is done for AdditionOperator
* In 'uninterruptible' contextmanager, ensure that the SIGINT handler is always put back in
