What's new ?
* new operators BlockSliceOperator, HardThresholdingOperator and SoftThresholdingOperator
* add commin and commout as operator's attribute, to deal with input and output communicators. Handling of implicit communicators. Add propagation mechanism.
* add MPI helper functions combine, distribute, distribute_shapes, mprint, filter_comm, as_mpi
* add function product
* when combined with a block operator, split DiagonalOperators and ConstantOperators
* add operator's flag 'universal', used in rules involving operators and block operators
* infer implicit partition during addition, multiplication or composition
* binary rule for DiagonalOperator and BlockOperator, including broadcasting
* API change: broadcasting method is now 'leftward' or 'rightward'
* implement Operator's __eq__
* automatically set 'inplace' flag for ufuncs
* make BlockRowOperator handle arbitrary reduction operation, optimize direct method by using the memory manager
* automatic morphing of DiagonalOperator into IdentityOperator, ZeroOperator, HomothetyOperator or MaskOperator according to diagonal values
* fix involutary flag in DiagonalOperators
* add simplification fules: op + O -> op and op x I -> op
