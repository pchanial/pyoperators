What's new ?
* add a @nbytes@ property, indicating the operator storage footprint.
* @delete@ method for operators, to force deletion of an operator, alongside its associated operators. If the storage footprint of the deleted operators exceeds a certain threshold @GC_NBYTES_THRESHOLD@, a garbage collection is triggered.
* ProxyOperator for on-the-fly computations. In a group of proxy operators, only one actual operator is cached. The proxy operators inherit all the properties from the actual operators.
* add a context manager @setting@ to change a global variable value.
 
Under the hood:
* Renamed operator flag 'inplace_reduction' -> 'update_output'. And make it a regular flag, i.e. the 'update_output' is no more inferred from the @direct@ method signature.
* allow generators in composite operators.
