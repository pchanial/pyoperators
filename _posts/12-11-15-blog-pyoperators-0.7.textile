What's new ?
* Raising an operator to an integer exponent.
* New operator DifferenceOperator.
* New Variable class and X instance.
* Expose pcg function, instead of PCGAlgorithm
* In a composition, HomothetyOperator has a distinct and more efficient handling. It can now be absorbed by the operands.
* New composition rules for ReshapeOperator, real ConvolutionOperator, BlockSliceOperator, DenseOperator
* New class for the transpose of the real-kernel convolution (subclassing the real-kernel convolution), so that composition and addition rules can be applied to both the convolution and its transpose.

Under the hood:
* Fix todense for operators requiring aligned arrays.
* Use site.USER_BASE instead of ~/.local to store FFTW wisdom and make environment variable PYOPERATORSPATH override it.
* New lanczos implementation.
* Make EigendecompositionOperator subclass CompositionOperator
* API change: DistributionGlobalOperator->MPIDistributionGlobalOperator
