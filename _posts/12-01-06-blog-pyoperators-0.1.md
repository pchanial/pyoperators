This is the first release.  
The pyoperators package is the result of the merging of the packages
[Tamasis/PACS](https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-pacs) (v3) by Pierre
Chanial and the package
[linear\_operators](https://github.com/nbarbey/linear_operators) by
Nicolas Barbey, picking up the best out of the two.
