"""
The operators contains the following packages:

- core : defines the Operator class

- linear : defines standard linear operators (can be seen as matrices)
- nonlinear : defines non-linear operators (such as thresholding or rounding)
- iterative : defines iterative algorithms working with operators

- pywt_operators : (optional) loaded if PyWavelets is present.
